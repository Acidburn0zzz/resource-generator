[Equivalence]
NameString=Affymetrix Probe Set Identifier Equivalences
DescriptionString=Affymetrix probe set identifier equivalences were derived from mappings to Entrez Gene IDs from NetAffx. For probe sets annotated to multiple Entrez Gene IDs, a single ID was selected as follows: the Entrez Gene ID with the highest priority RefSeq status was selected (from high to low priority - Reviewed, Validated, Provisional, Predicted, Model, Inferred, none). Gene IDs with the RefSeq status 'suppressed' were not used. When multiple Entrez Gene IDs shared the highest priority RefSeq status, the lowest numbered ID was selected.
